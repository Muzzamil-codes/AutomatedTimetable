## Introduction
This project automatically generates a timetable based on changing prayer times and controls computer applications to support focus on scheduled tasks. It closes all open windows to create a distraction-free environment and then opens specific applications depending on the current activity. For instance, during study time, it opens a learning portal, while during side project time, it launches an image editor and a browser. Notifications remind the user of each task, and a log records actions and any issues. This project helps maintain focus and productivity throughout the day in alignment with prayer times.
